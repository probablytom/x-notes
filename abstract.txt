# Abstract

Interacting with our computers has always been cold and impersonal. What if
that could change?

Computer science research has produced software -- algorithms -- which produce
human-like behaviour in a computer system like an artificial intelligence.
This software, termed "anthropomorphic algorithms", guides an AI's behaviour in
a human-like way. Examples of this behaviour might be an understanding of
trust, comfort, and reputation; my own research is on using responsibility
models to guide an AI's behaviour.

It's clear that, as this research becomes more advanced, it will affect all
sorts of fields in exciting ways. Philosophical questions arise: if a computer
can have feelings and empathise, is it immoral to treat it badly? If a city can
identify distress and panic after a crime, might it alter the environment on
the citizens' behalf? If your phone has an understanding of regret, should it
stop you from leaving your ex voicemails when you're drunk? There are some of
the uses anthropomorphic algorithms might have in disciplines outside of
computer science, and the potential is unbounded.

With all of this potential impact, it's important to begin to explore the
interdisciplinary impact of these algorithms. What fields might be impacted by
these developments -- and how? It is becoming increasingly important, and
increasingly valuable, to explore the applications of computers with human
traits outside of computer science research.
