# Biography

I'm a Computing Science student in the 5th year of my MSci programme. My
earlier research has included team organisation, experimental storytelling and
sociotechnical systems modelling --- I find the intersection of studying people
and computers fascinating.

My current research is an attempt to introduce human behaviours, such as
responsibility, into the behaviour of artificial systems. I'm especially
interested in how these developments can influence other fields, such as urban
development and philosophy. It's an exciting time to do interesting research!

I'm looking forward to doing more research on developing computational models
of human behaviours, and exploring how that research can bridge some of the
divide between computing science and other disciplines. Interdisciplinary
research is the most fascinating and interesting part of my time at university,
and I'm excited to share what I enjoy with the Let's Talk About [X] audience!
